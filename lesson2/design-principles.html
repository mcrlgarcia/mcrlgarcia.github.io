                    <p class="par3">The CNN website here is showing visual heirarchy.  
                        The headline "Impeachment debate rages" is what draws first attention, 
                        then the video and its headline.  the 3rd attention graber is the line 
                        that is smaller than the others but still gives important information 
                        on the article "THE SECOND TRUMP IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS". Though this 
                        line is smaller it still grabs attention by using capital letters and 
                        red lettering.</p>

                    <p class="par3">Walmart website uses Law of Proximity well.  The topic line 
                        "At-home must-haves" have links that are grouped together and appear as 
                        the whole. The website continues the Law of Proximity on the other topic 
                        lines. Each topic goes together well to complete and give an appealing 
                        view.</p>

                    <p class="par3">This Home Depot website displays Hicks Law by helping to direct 
                        choices by categorizing links and each link leading to category with filtering 
                        of choices to guide a user more easily to what is being sought. This seems to 
                        be popular among websites that have many items to sell.</p>
